The `supervisor` crate is a Rust library for managing and monitoring asynchronous tasks within the Tokio runtime. It ensures tasks remain operational by tracking their health via heartbeats and restarting them if they fail or become unresponsive.

## Installation

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
supervisor = "0.1.0"  # Replace with the latest version
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
async-trait = "0.1"
```

##Â Usage

###Â 1. Defining a Supervised Task

Tasks must implement the `SupervisedTask` trait, which requires an error type and the run_forever method:

```rust
use supervisor::SupervisedTask;
use async_trait::async_trait;
use std::time::Duration;

#[derive(Clone)]
struct MyTask;

#[async_trait]
impl SupervisedTask for MyTask {
    type Error = std::io::Error;

    fn name(&self) -> Option<&str> {
        Some("my_task")
    }

    async fn run_forever(&mut self) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
        loop {
            tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
            println!("Task is running");
        }
    }
}
```

###Â 2. Setting Up and Running the Supervisor

Use the `SupervisorBuilder` to create a supervisor and start supervising tasks:

```rust
use supervisor::SupervisorBuilder;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut supervisor = SupervisorBuilder::default()
        .with_task(MyTask)
        .build();

    supervisor.run_and_supervise().await;
}
```

The supervisor will:
1. Start all tasks, each running its run_forever logic.
2. Send heartbeats every second to confirm task health.
3. Restart tasks that fail or miss heartbeats.


### 3. Checking Task Status

Retrieve the status of all tasks at any time:

```rust
let statuses = supervisor.task_statuses();
for (name, status) in statuses {
    println!("Task '{}': {:?}", name, status);
}
```

Statuses include `Created`, `Starting`, `Healthy`, `Failed`, and `Dead`.
